[Digital Marketing Jargon Buster PDF](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/assets/media/pdf/2-digital-marketing-glossary.pdf)

## Digital Opportunity

### How can a business benefit from being online?

The main advantage is appearing in search engine results.

Secondary advantages include click-throughs from Social media, Digital Advertisements, A website link for physical advertisements; and an endless amount of other possibilities.

A customer may be drawn in to visit the main website by first seeing:

* Pricing

* Testimonials

* Proximity via Maps

Or really, any other online content that is put up, such as tutorials or reviews.

### An Online Presence can also provide valuable customer information

* What your customers want

* When they want it

* How to deliver it to them

* What they are willing to pay

### The biggest challenge for businesses

It's not using the tools, it's putting the plan together

Consider:

* The Scope: Web, Mobile, Social

* The Technology and Content: Technical aspects, Creative aspects,

* Cost and Time: A realistic budget, and achievable schedule; with clear milestones

> Create a wish list of your digital presence. What components are you already using? What would you like to add? Start writing down your ideas, and take the first step towards developing a digital plan.

### SEO vs SEM

---

SEM is Search Engine Marketing, a term made up for paying search engines to use your ads as targeted ads to show search engine users (Google ads)

* Most of these use an **Auction System** where companies fight for relevancy by bidding on the *Keywords* that they would like to target

In SEM, the business pays to enter an auction. They then bid for advertising space on a website, and whoever wins gets to show their search ad.

### Starting Goalsetting

---

* Write down the digital goals you believe you can accomplish within six months.

Next to each goal, estimate the costs, time and resources you'll need to achieve them.

* Then, ask yourself: are you dependent on any one technology?

That could be a sign that you could be more flexible.

* Write down all the places your business currently “lives” online, from listings, to social media sites, to your own website, if you have one.

* Now, write a wish list of options you’d like to include in the future.

Next to each, jot down ideas about what you might include there, like content and functionality.

How can you encourage customers to interact with you online?

### Your Website

---

* The tone your site uses should tell the story of the business and what it offers.

For most businesses, everyday language would be suitable, but it may not be appropriate for businesses such as law firms.

* Be wary of coming across as arrogant and over-confident; trying to provide a sales pitch, rather than explaining how the business could meet the customer’s need.

* Make a list of things you’d like people to do on your website, like find your phone number, fill out a contact form or watch a video.

* Then, ask a friend or relative (who hasn’t seen your website) to try to accomplish those tasks.

If possible, watch them as they navigate your site.

Can they do it? Are some areas of the site difficult to navigate? Can you find any places that might be improved?

## Online Business Strategy

---

* How to identify what makes a business stand out in a busy marketplace

* Why Unique Selling Points (USPs) are important and how to construct them

* Look at what your competitors are doing to find out what's working well for them, and what isn’t.

This would provide you with a broader market view, and would highlight potential opportunities which you could use to formulate a strategy for your own company's growth.

* By conducting a **SWOT(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)** analysis, you can identify opportunities that will allow the business to grow - as well as highlight weaknesses you could resolve.

> Take ten minutes out of your day and use a search engine to research the following terms: 1. A business name - this will show you the competition for keywords and branding. 2. A product or service - this will show you who the competition is for that product or service. 3. Include your location - this highlights competitors who are local to you, that offer the same services. These searchable terms are 'keywords' that are associated with a brand or product. These keywords are what people will use to find a business or product online, so it's important to know who or what else appears when customers search the web.

* Why setting goals and **KPIs(Key Performance Indicators)** is so important to online businesses
* How to construct a KPI using the SMART framework
* How to analyse data gathered to help improve online marketing efforts.

KPIs should be:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Attainable
* Relevant
* Time bound

When should you measure it? Weekly? Monthly?

> A KPI can be anything that gets you closer to achieving your goals. Have a think about the types of KPIs you could introduce

### Online Business Strategy Recap

* The first step is to **clearly define your goals**
* The **'See, Think, Do, Care'** framework is a useful way to understand the online customer journey. Being aware of this journey helps a business to identify where they should invest their efforts in connecting with customers.

* **Optimising customer touchpoints** online is a valuable way for businesses to build brand loyalty and trust.
* Once you've worked out your **USP**, you should aim to incorporate it within your marketing materials across all channels.
This will help promote your brand awareness and hopefully leave a lasting impact in the minds of your audience.

* **KPIs** can help you to make smart business decisions from long-term projections about your business's growth and development.
You can use these to evaluate how successful your online efforts may be towards reaching your business goals.

## Starting Search

---

### Ranking

If lots of sites use the same content then it will be hard for any one of them to stand out in the search list.

* How search engines rank sites is their ‘special sauce’ – the details of exactly how this works is a closely guarded secret.

* **Organic Search Results** just means "unpaid-for", or actual results; those that aren't paying to be artifically boosted

### Advertisements

Although they contain the same content as organic search results, paid ad results have a different position on the page. In addition, it’s usually made clear to people that these are adverts or paid results, so users are aware they are clicking on an ad, and there’s no trickery involved.

* A great benefit for the advertiser is that they're only charged if users click on the ad, not by how many times it appears in the search results.

### Google Search Console

When it comes to your website, the more information you have, the better.

[Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters)

* **Google Search Console can help you to figure out if the keywords you're using on the website are helping** it appear in the search results for the kinds of searches your customers are making. It can also show you whether appearing in these results is translating into visits to his website from potential customers.

* Google Search Console can recommend better page titles, but it can’t recommend more effective content for you to use, or show you the type of people who usually search for businesses like you.

### SEO

[SEO Jargon Buster - PDF](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/assets/media/pdf/6-seo-glossary.pdf)

[Google Trends - Research Keywords](https://trends.google.com/trends/)
> *Personal note: Google Trends seems to be skewed, dishonest garbage, and largely broken; for example "Junior Web Developer" apparently had ZERO results across Canada, and I am expected to believe that the top search of the day was "who the new drummer for the Foo Fighters is(Obvious MSM-Propped BS, Nobody has cared about that band for over a decade)(Secondary note: Google thinks I am in the UK but inquiring about Canada at the present time)*

There are four steps to creating an SEO plan.

1. Do some keyword research and consider related topics. That way you’ll know what people are searching for.

2. See where you appear in the search results for those keywords.

3. See if there are gaps where keywords aren’t bringing traffic to the site

4. If 3, Plan ways to fix these gaps and improve SEO performance.

> Start creating an SEO plan by considering how to perform better in organic search for your most popular product or service. Which keywords seem important but aren't sending you much traffic? How could you fix that? You can use Google Trends to research keywords.

* SEO work is never finished – search engines evolve and so do trends.

That means you should refine your keywords over time and don’t assume that if something works you can keep doing the same thing forever. Instead, **keep up with how search engines work and how they’re changing**.

* Get inspiration from other websites and don’t forget to **get feedback from your customers**.

* Remember, no agency can grant you top organic search positions. If someone does offer you this then it’s probably a scam.

* **Long-Tail Keywords:**
The long tail of SEO means longer keyword phrases that are very specific to whatever you’re selling.
These have a **low search volume**, which means there’s **less competition**, so it’s **more likely to be relevant** to a user’s queries.

* **Analytics tools** are a great way to get information about how content is performing, who visits the site and turns into a customer, and what content they interact with.

> Do you want to increase revenue? Expand your customer base? Now list the things you want visitors to do on your site that contribute to these goals.

### Starting Search Recap

* **Search engines look at how popular a site is** and then build a domain authority based upon relevant links to and from that site. This demonstrates the site's trust and popularity.

* The first step of an SEO plan should be to conduct keyword research.

* **Bid value**, together with **quality score**, is one of the components that will dictate your ad's position in the search results page. By increasing your bid on specific keywords you're more likely to outrank your competitor's ads.

* **Long-tail keywords** are phrases made up of two or three words and are used to target more niche demographics, therefore they generally have a lower search volume.

* **Increasing relevant traffic** to your website would make an ideal goal for a SEO plan.

## Make Search Work For You

---

The title and meta description are used by the search engine to generate the actual search result, so they’d appear in the search results page.

### Backlinks (Links to You from Others)

You need to work hard to get backlinks – that means links to your site from other websites. To do that you needs to produce quality content, such as writing recipes. you can also encourage people to write about your business.

* Social media is a great way to improve visibility, but search engines don’t recognise the number of likes or followers an account has, so this won’t help the search rankings.

### International SEO

* Search engine best practise is to create individual pages for each language that you wish to support on your website. Doing this will help ensure that your website is correctly indexed by search engines.

* Using an automated translator is sometimes seen as spam, so you should avoid that too.

* Localized domain names assist search engines in finding your content, such as canadianapples.ca and britishapples.co.uk

## Be Noticed With Search ads (SEM)

---

[Search Engine Marketing Jargon Buster - PDF](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/assets/media/pdf/8-sem-glossary.pdf)

By specifically targeting people interested in your website, you can use online advertising to directly connect with future customers.

* The paid advertisements are the ones that appear at the top and/or right side of the page

* When you’re advertising on a search engine, the ‘quality’ of your advert heading is all-important. It needs to be very aligned to the keywords you’re targeting.

* In an **SEM auction**, the **Bid is multiplied by the Relevency score** (1-10), therefore a *high relevency trumps a high bid*, and you can only out bid those at the top of Relevency when you are at the top yourself.

> Make a list of keywords you think are relevant to your business. Now, have a look at them with keyword research tools like [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/). How much traffic can you expect? What’s the estimated cost? Can you find other keywords you hadn’t thought of?

* Relevence is the name of the game when it comes to SEM

* Ads need to stand out from the crowd.

* It *works best when the headline is similar to what the customer would be searching for*, and for example, with "Thing you're searching for in city, Get %25 off today!" the discount grabs people’s attention, and there’s a clear and compelling call to action.

> Does your business have any offers or promotions that you can use in your adverts? Brainstorm a few calls to action that will help potential customers understand what they should do when they reach your website.

### Be Noticed With Search ads Recap

* Search engine marketing is also known as pay-per-click or PPC
* Quality Score measures the relevance of your web page against the copy in your ad
* You can use services like Google Adwords to see the performance of a keyword before you decide to bid on it. This means you can invest your marketing budget where it will have the most impact for your business.
* Your **call to action**, or **CTA**, could be 'Click to learn more' or 'Book now' prompting the user to complete an action once reading/viewing your advert

## Improve Search Campaigns

---

[Bing Keyword Research Tool](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/keyword-research-628070b6)

To succeed as an advertiser, you need to create adverts that help searchers find what they’re looking for – and when you do, search engines may reward you

* Grouping keywords and ads into "Campaigns" means that you can show ads that are relevant to what customers are searching for.

If Anna is a Photographer and makes a Campaign targeting Wedding Photos, If someone searches for ‘candid wedding photos’ they see the ad specifically for her wedding photography services.

Anna can run different campaigns for these ads and keep track of them separately, maybe one for Baby photos, and anpther for Real Estate.

* **Negative keywords** are like opposite-keywords, words that are making your content hit for searches that you don't want them to.

For example, you are an Italian Restaurant but you don't sell Pizza, you could then add a negative keyword **"-pizza"** to stop those who are looking for "Italian Pizza" in your area from seeing and clicking on your ad (which costs you money and leaves them disappointed)

### Keyword Match Types

Search engines often show your ads for keywords that are slightly different from the ones you’re targeting. The solution: keyword match types.

* Refining keywords by changing them from ‘broad match’ to ‘phrase match’ and ‘exact match’ means that you will probably notice a decrease in traffic, but the quality of the traffic you gets will increase. That’s because when your ad appears to a customer, it’s likely to be relevant to what the customer is looking for.

* By narrowing keywords to exact matches like ‘Film themed portrait photography, low cost’ Anna the Portrait Photographer is more likely to get traffic for her more niche business, and therefore paying customers.

* One of the best ways to *measure how well your search engine marketing is working* is by **tracking conversions**, or actions you’d like website visitors to take

* When Anna installs tracking code to her website, she’ll get reports telling her how many conversions she got.

If Anna wants to track her Inquiries; If she places the conversion tracking code on the page that appears when a customer has sent their enquiry, she’ll know when a customer has actually sent an enquiry. Her data won’t get mixed up with people who have visited the enquiries page but decided not to send an enquiry.

## Get Noticed Locally

---

These days people are used to using their phones when they’re out and about to get information quickly.

That’s why it’s so important to create a local online presence for your business.

* At a minimum, you need to include a business name, address, telephone number and opening hours to have a listing in a local directory.

You can also add other optional information such as photos of products, depending on the listing site.

> Visit one of the major local directories, such as Google’s, Yahoo’s or Bing’s. Search for your business to see if it is already listed and follow the steps to claim your listing. If you have already claimed the listing, make sure it’s optimised so that your listings are consistent, current and are placed in proper categories.

* Registering your business on local listings is a great step to take when marketing online for the first time. These listings appear on search engine results pages so you can increase your chance of being found.

* You can set up her ad campaigns to only bid if the customer doing the search is within 10 miles of her shop. you can also set it to only bid during the hours that you're open. With local ads, you can tailor your messages to people who are close to your shop.

* **GPS** is a great feature that Esmeralda can take advantage of.

Depending on the capabilities of the app she uses, Esmeralda can send sales alerts when customers are near the shop or simply use maps to navigate them to it.

The app can also help Esmeralda to remind people of events in her shop, send personalised coupons or let customers schedule appointments, but all this can work without GPS technology.

* For Esmeralda’s content to be geared to local searches, **it needs to focus on relevant content that identifies her shop’s location**.

A post about popular bike trails in the area has a local angle, so it would draw local interest.

* When search engines analyse a website they look for key pieces of information, such as your business address, to determine if you're local to the searching user. Other key factors include the quality of your content and how mobile friendly the site is.

* Advances in mobile voice search mean that local users look for local services using this technology. If your website isn't optimised for mobile it might not appear in the results or even put off a potential user due to poor usability.

## Get noticed with social media

---

Social media is all about connecting with your customers; starting a conversation with people can help customers get to know you and your company.

* Posting regularly keeps the conversation going, although make sure you don’t overload your followers with posts.

* Naming and shaming competitors and deleting all negative posts could reflect badly on you and put followers off. The same could be said of commenting too much on followers’ personal posts.

> Explore some of the popular social media sites you think your customers use, like Facebook, Twitter or Google+. As you do, write down the kinds of posts you could make there. What would this audience find interesting, funny or valuable... and want to share?

* A professional post looking for a contractor would be best positioned on LinkedIn, which is designed for professional networking.
* Professional-looking photos can be shared in multiple places by Instagram, a network designed for photo sharing.
* The post announcing her first late-night fashion show would be well positioned on Facebook where Lily could set up an event for customers to RSVP to.

> Consider your social media goals. Are you trying to build awareness? Are you looking for a way to communicate more with your customers? If you had to choose one goal to start, what would it be? How can you begin to put it into motion?

## Deep dive into social media

An organised social media plan and strategy will go a long way in saving you time and energy.

### Long-term Social Media Plan

* The first thing Lily needs to do is create a social media plan

1. Plan how she will engage with social media in the coming months
2. Identify how she will measure her results.
3. She can create profiles on the social media sites that best suit her business
4. Set up a social media management tool to keep track of her activity on those sites
5. Finally, she can prepare posts in advance that will be automatically posted to coincide with key events in her plan

> There are dedicated applications out there that can be found for managing multiple social media accounts and automatically posting pre-prepared content to them, such as [Hootsuite](https://www.hootsuite.com/) and [Mixpost](https://mixpost.app/)

* Social media analytics can help businesses gain knowledge about how customers interact with their products and services and how they have accessed them.

They are useful for figuring out which campaigns are the most effective at driving traffic to the shop’s website

> Log in to some of the social networks you use and see what kinds of reports are available.

* The big benefit of social media is being able to talk directly to customers and engage with them in a timely and appropriate way.

In the event of bad PR, you now have the opportunity to resolve this customer complaint by offering an apology, or to replace the service for free, thus showing customers how important they are to your business.

### Social Media Recap

* Having a long-term schedule of posts and ideas in advance means you can free up more time to complete other tasks but still keep a consistent appearance on social.
* Promoting your posts(paid) on social media enables you to target certain audiences that have not yet been exposed to your products or services
* Social media analytics can tell you if a site visitor clicked through from a paid ad or organic post.
* Making sure you have the resources to deal with comments, questions and complaints is a key consideration when setting up your social media profiles.

## Mobile

---

When people search for businesses, they are quite likely to be searching on a mobile device. Search engines are adapting to this new approach, and businesses need to adapt as well

> Mobile Optimization Tools [gtmetrix - Loading Speed Tester](https://gtmetrix.com/) , [Google's PageSpeed tools - Analyze and optimize your website](https://developers.google.com/speed) , [webpagetest - Site Performance Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/) , [Google's Mobile-Friendly Test](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-ca/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-tools-to-optimize-site-and-app/)

* List any actions customers complete on your mobile site that can be integrated into an app in order to streamline the process before deciding weather or not to go through with getting a custom Mobile App

* Push notifications generate a pop-up on a mobile device with a message or call to action from the publisher. Users don't have to be in the app or using their devices to receive them.

> Having a website that loads quickly, is easy to navigate on mobile and caters to multiple device types, contributes positively towards your quality score for mobile SEO.

When people type on a mobile device they’re usually using a touchpad keyboard, which is slower to use than a desktop.

* Make sure you keep your keywords short, snappy and easy to type with thumbs!

* By choosing the right keywords you are much more likely to bring people to your website

* Are your calls to action front and center?

* Are text and buttons large so visitors can easily read them?

> Read about how to use [Google's Display Planner]((https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/products/display-planner.html)) to find ways to target your audience on the Display Network

* Target the right audience for a social media campaign by using parameters such as age, location and interests.

* Mobile video consumption is on the rise, which means businesses should be following the trend towards advertising with video (Youtube Video Ads etc)

> Video doesn't have to be expensive. Have you ever considered filming a short video advert on your mobile?

* Most people prefer to watch short and snappy videos, but if you can present your material in a really engaging way you could probably hold the viewer’s attention for longer. It all depends on the needs of your customers, so before you shoot the video, do some research into what will appeal to them most.

> Create a storyline for a potential mobile video ad. What's your call to action? Remember to keep the mobile video ad short, but relevant.

* Businesses can target ad campaigns to people based on their relationship status. It is also possible to target by life events/milestones such as newly engaged and newlywed. This gives businesses the chance to tailor ads to their customers' lifestyles.

## Get started with content marketing

---

[Content Marketing Ideas](https://thedsmgroup.com/content-marketing-ideas/)

### Create Audience Profiles

Find out **who your audience is**, and then **try to "Segment" that audience into groups** that you can then **individually target**

[yougov - Public Opinion Approval Rating Tracker](https://today.yougov.com/)

[Answer The Public - Most popular question searches by Topic](https://answerthepublic.com)

* Use the tools mentioned in above to **start making profiles of your target audience**:

* Give each one a name, and then **note jobs and other characteristics**, such as:

1. Who do they follow on Twitter?
2. Which newspaper do they read?
3. What TV shows do they watch?

This will help inform your content marketing strategy and allow you to make sure the content you create is aimed specifically at one of your audience profiles.

### Choosing the right format

[Copy Blogger - Your free content marketing education](https://copyblogger.com/)

From entertaining GIFs to blog posts, whitepapers, and full-length videos, understanding which content format can make the most impact on your audience is critical.

The different goals of content are to:

1. Inform
2. Educate
3. Inspire
4. Entertain

These could come in a variety of formats, from Videos, to Blog articles, to Infographics

> Spend 20 minutes online researching the different formats content marketing can appear in. What do you notice? Try coming up with ways you could utilise these content types for your business or product.

### Writing for an online audience

[Grammarly - Generative AI assistance and writing suggestions](https://www.grammarly.com/)

* It's important to adapt your writing style to an online audience

* Remember to focus on the target audience and find a consistent style and tone of voice.

* You should always aim for quality writing over quantity

* Remember to open each blog post with an engaging hook.

* Come up with a concept for a blog article. Think about writing on a topic you know will resonate with your readers. Before you start writing, consider **two distinct audience profiles**.
Come up with characteristics for both audience profiles and detail the following:

1. Their age
2. Their job roles
3. What interests they have
4. What matters to them
5. How much they already know on the subject

Now, **draft two different versions of the same blog article** for the *different audience types*.
Do you **alter your tone**? Does the **language you use** change, based on the audience's existing knowledge level and terminology?

### Help your content be seen

Once you've created content, knowing how to distribute and promote it online is key to getting the reaction that you want.

* Check all the channels that are available
* Decide what content to create based on the needs of the audience
* Consider building a content calendar to help stay organized

> Next time you create a piece of content, try distributing the same piece via different channels. For example, create a blog on your website and promote it via different social media platforms at different times of the day. Record your findings to help inform your content marketing strategy moving forward. Different audiences use different platforms, at different times of the day. See what works for your audience.

### Measuring your success in content marketing

Knowing how well your content performs once it's published online will help you understand your audience, as well as provide you with insights as to how to improve campaigns in the future.

* Open the analytics feature within one of your social media platforms. Explore which posts were most successful by looking at metrics such as:

1. Views
2. Engagement (Likes or Comments)
3. Shares

Next, use this data to extract some top-level insights that will help improve the quality of what you are doing going forward.

### Review

* Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach. By sharing valuable and relevant content on a regular basis, you are aiming to attract and retain your audience and drive profitable customer actions.

* Businesses would struggle if targeting an entire mass market. Segmenting your audience gives you the opportunity to better match the customer's needs and only target those interested, resulting in better opportunities for growth.

* When creating content you should aim to achieve specific business goals. The four main purposes of content are usually: to entertain your audience, inspire their actions, educate them further and convince them to complete an action.

* Adapt offline writing styles to online behaviour, whilst keeping in mind that users have varying **attention spans** i.e. most people have a very short attention span.

* A content calendar can be used to plan and organise the process of creating content for key dates: from brainstorming ideas through to writing and publishing across multiple platforms.

* **Session duration** gives you a good indication of whether viewers had found the blog content relevant to them.

## Email marketing basics

---

Sending newsletters and special offers to customers via email can play a key part in your overall marketing plan.

You can use email marketing to tell customers about products and promotions, and even to send out discount vouchers and special offers.

* If you know some of your customers’ product preferences, you can send out emails with content tailored for them.

* Email marketing won’t let customers contact each other over email, and they’re often sent from a ‘no reply’ address, so customers wouldn’t be able to reply to them with problems or queries.

### Email Marketing Options

Many email marketing software systems will guide you through the entire process of setting up an effective email campaign.

Look up a few email marketing services and browse through their features. Choose one and sign up for an account. Often you can take advantage of a free trial for a limited time. Use your free trial time to put together a test campaign to become familiar with how these services work.

### Crafting Marketing Emails

You want to craft attention-grabbing emails that encourage action:

1. Use subject lines to make a good first impression
2. Write concise content with strong calls to action
3. Include helpful links for customers.

### Managing successful email campaigns

A/B testing is where you create two different emails and send each to only half of your email list, and then see which version had a better response so you can better tailor your future emails.

> Write a sample marketing email. Now come up with a few different subject lines that you could use A/B testing to choose between.

* Knowing whether your email campaigns are successful will help you take the right actions when it comes time to improving them

Develop three variations of an email campaign. In each email, change up the subject line, the headline and the key images. Measure which email performs better across all of the metrics we have covered in this lesson. Pay attention to metrics like:

1. Open rate
2. Click Through rate
3. Bounce rate

What do these metrics tell you? What patterns start to appear?

### Review

* In order to start sending out emails, you'll need a way of collecting email addresses. For example, a signup form on your website so that people interested can be kept up to date through email.

* Most email marketing platforms come with a link included in each email allowing the user to unsubscribe from your email marketing list.

* It's good practice to run split testing on your email subject line. This way you can see which subject line is more successful and also further understand your customers' behaviour and interests.

* If the open rate of your email is low try adjusting the subject line of the email.

* When running email marketing campaigns, you should monitor the campaigns' success using analytics software.

## Display Advertizing - Advertise on other websites

---

By incorporating a mix of both display and search engine advertising, you’ll be able to maximise your online visibility.

A search ad would only show up when people are searching for keywords on a search engine. This is known as search engine marketing (SEM).

Once a person moves away from a search engine, search ads can no longer target them.

* This is where **display ads** come in.

These **can appear on any website** where paid advertising space is available.

* Display ads can contain graphics, audio and even video

* You can target people who haven't found your website yet, but that have an interest in the types of things you write about.

### Making Display Ad-Campaigns Meet Your Goals

From the start, you should design your display advertising campaigns to help you achieve your goals.

* **Advertising networks** connect large groups of websites offering advertising space with people who want to advertise on them.

> Ad networks such as **Google Display Network** or **Yahoo** are a great, cost-effective way for you to get the attention of individual websites. Ad networks find ad spaces on websites, and sort out payment so you won’t have to.

> Go to your favourite search engine and do a search for **“display ad network”**. Take a look through the results and get familiar with some of the various ad networks and what they have to offer.

### Retargeting

* Retargeting allows you to advertise to groups of visitors to your website based on the things they did when they visited

* Retargeting ads are a way of bringing potential customers back to a site.

In the case of a TV Podcast site:

A tailored ad that asks someone to return wouldn’t be relevant for people who are searching with the keywords ‘TV podcasts’ because they’ve not actually visited the website yet. This is the same for film forum users from other sites. These two audiences would need to be targeted using a different advert.

However, website homepage visitors, ‘almost’ subscribers and those who download the e-catalogue are all aware of the website and can be retargeted to draw them back.

> Go to your favourite search engine and do some searches for commercial retargeting options.

## Make the most of video

---

According to analysts, one minute of video is worth 1.8 million words!(Lol wtf crack is being smoked at Google for this one?)

They are a great way to communicate with the world. Videos can go viral and be targeted at the same time to reach a broad audience.

* Write out your online marketing goals. How can you make use of videos to achieve those goals? Do you need to produce video content, or could you simply advertise on other relevant videos?

* By **planning ahead**, you can **shoot several videos at a time** – with less effort, **fewer resources** and a **smaller budget**.

1. Plan the video release schedule
2. Storyboard the video content
3. Decide on a location and source props
4. Find a video crew and film the videos
5. Edit then upload the videos

> Remember, storyboarding your video content is an essential step to make sure you get the audio script, graphics, movement and angles right before you start.

* Brainstorm three video ideas you could film using the same location and actors, say a series of video how-tos.

Remember – you don’t have to produce a major motion picture! The most popular videos are relatively brief.

### Sharing And Promoting Video

* When uploading your video use a suitable title, set of search terms and description. These will make sure people find your video. And when posting on social media, always use a relevant hashtag.

And finally, you should encourage people to do something when they’ve watched your video – for example, ask them to share your video or visit your website.

* When you create your keywords, you need to think like your customer. What will they be searching for?

Being specific is often better as it means your content will be more relevant to the search and increase the likelihood of someone visiting your site.

* Be sure your ad gives viewers a reason to visit your website and remember, you want them to keep coming back for more.

* Analytics can give you insights into the people who watch your videos and how they engage with your content. With this information at hand, you can improve your videos and grow your audience.

* In most cases, short videos work best.

You can increase the likelihood that people will play your videos and watch them to the end by keeping them brief. Statistics show that **after one minute**, 45% of viewers will **stop** watching.

Also, **checking comments** can be a useful way to find out **why people aren’t watching the video through** to the end.

### Review

* Creating a how-to video for a product or service that a business sells can help answer customer queries, encourage sales and increase engagement with the brand. While providing value to the customer, these videos can also help businesses reach multiple goals.

* Videos can help you to engage with customers in many ways, such as answering FAQ's or sharing details on your product and services.

* There is no need to invest a fortune in your video content as a small business. As long as you plan, storyboard and get creative you can achieve great things.

* With so much content online, video is a great way to attract the attention of your audience when using email marketing.(Put a thumbnail link to a video in an email)

* Even if you haven't created a video of your own, you can still take advantage of the medium by advertising your business on someone else's video using many different formats. For example, text ads and pop-ups.

* Updating the components that might be drawing in the wrong audience or boasting something not included in the video would be better than re-shooting or deleting the video in its entirety. Always try this approach first before investing in a complete re-filming.

## Get started with analytics

---

By clearly outlining your business goals, you can then utilise analytics data to help you refine and improve your website and meet your objectives.

* Metrics are measurable, numerical data like time spent on site or pages viewed.

* Conversions are data on how many users have completed a desired action on your site, for example buying a product or signing up for a newsletter.

* Dimensions are groups of user data that can be used to generate a report, such as their device type or location.

Imagine Linda had 1,000 visitors to her website last week – 1,000 is a metric. 500 of those visitors are from France, 300 from Italy and 200 from Germany. Those countries are dimensions - they organise visitors into groups sharing common characteristics, such as their country of origin.

Finally, let’s say 300 of last week’s visitors signed up for Linda's newsletter. Those 300 signups are conversions - visitors who did something on Linda's website that is important for her business.

> Do a search for “web analytics tools” and open an account with one of the tools that you like. **Google Analytics** could be a great place for you to start.

* One of the biggest benefits of going online is that digital marketing is extremely measurable. Throughout the entire customer journey, web analytics provides insight on where your website visitors are coming from, what they’re doing and how you can get more of them to “convert” on your site.

* Before making big changes like sending more newsletters or stopping them altogether, Linda should **review the newsletters** to **find out why** people are **unsubscribing**.

How many is she sending a week? Is she **sending too many**? Is the content of the newsletters the best it can be?

Linda should **focus on improving the quality** of the newsletters and **monitor** whether the numbers of people unsubscribing drops.

* Web analytics tools can give you valuable information to help you meet your objectives. You can do this by setting up your web analytics tool to track the specific goals that you care about

> Take a look at your website. Why do you have a website? Write down every answer you can think of, because that's a goal you can track with analytics.

* Website analytics instantly provide data that can tell us a story about what current customers on a site are doing, as well reveal trends using historical data about previous customer behaviours.

* Knowing who booked a room using your site, where they came from online and how much time they spent on various pages of the website are all valuable pieces of information. The most important metric, however, when aiming to reach your goal of conversion, is to track and review precisely how many people visiting your website actually booked with you.

### Find success with analytics

Analytics can tell Linda a lot of interesting information about her organic search performance.

It won’t tell her explicitly whether her site’s content is relevant to her keywords.

To understand that, she can look at information such as:

1. How long visitors spend on her site
2. The bounce rate, to see whether her site is giving her customers the information they are looking for

## Measuring Your SEM

When it comes to SEM, you’re paying real money for every click that brings visitors to your website.

Use web analytics to make sure you’re getting the most out of your investment

Use Analytics Data With SEM to Know:

1. Which keywords are paying for themselves
2. How to understand which ads are working
3. How to use analytics to help you bid smarter.

The key is not just to track the number of clicks on an ad, but more importantly the conversion rate.

> Take a look at your analytics reports. Find two keywords that are performing well. Why do you think they are doing well? Then, find two keywords that aren't performing as well. What do you think you can do to improve their performance?

Linda can use segmented information to find out where people are visiting her guesthouse from, and how many conversions she gets. She can also find out if many people book using their mobiles, or if they prefer booking on their computers.

With this information Linda can make improvements to her website and keep monitoring results.

* Analytics can tell you a lot about the visitors to your website. You can use this data, such as location, device and interests to tailor the content in your ads and on your website.

* If you have an underperforming ad, reviewing the copy, tweaking it and then analysing the results of the changes is a good tactic for learning what works for your audience type.

* Through the acquisition tab on Google Analytics you can see where and when people arrived on your site from social media. If tracking your links using UTMs, you can also track which specific social posts referred them.

## Turn data into insights

---

Collecting and analysing data can offer many benefits to online businesses. To take advantage of these benefits, it's important to first understand the types of data available to you as well as the best way to gather it.

* The differences between quantitative and qualitative data = Numerical Data VS Contexual Data(Or any relevant information that you **can't** ascribe a number to)

For example, Number of Views VS The color scheme mood of the page

* Analytics tools allow you to collect and review data in real time, enabling you to gain valuable insights by analysing this information.

> If you haven't already done so, setting up analytics on your website is one of the best ways to start collecting data.

### The Data Cycle

The elements of the "data cycle" are:

1. Plan: Identify your goals for the campaign, and how you plan to promote it
2. Do: Design the ads and Launch the campaign
3. Check: Review the analytics data from the campaign and determine it's effectiveness
4. Act: Use these findings to improve future campaigns by taking action and testing the hypothesis

Lee is having much more success on social media than he is via his emails. Focusing his attention on the platforms that are working for him will help increase his success.

In addition, his audience are online between the hours of 5.00 p.m. and 7.00 p.m., which could be because they are commuters, or professionals who have finished work for the day. Optimising when he publishes his posts will also result in being able to reach more of his audience at the optimal/peak time.

Use this information to improve future posts:

1. What works for your audience, and what doesn't?
2. Does posting at a particular time of day likely to make it more successful?
3. Are posts with images more engaging?
4. If you tag another person or business in the post, do you see more success?

**Spreadsheets** are a great place to store and manage your digital marketing data.

* Think of your social media data and try creating a spreadsheet that can be used to track all of your social media metrics on a daily basis:

1. Create a row for each social media channel
2. In the columns, input the following in the first row: number of followers, total number of 'likes' (or other social media metrics from each platform), engagement (for example, for Twitter this would be retweets/replies, for Facebook this would be shares/comments), and any other metric useful to your specific goals (such as hashtag use or conversion rates).
3. Use formulas to calculate the totals and averages. Be sure to update the table regularly with the latest data so that you can review how each social media channel performs over time.

### Charts

* The bar graph clearly shows each year's data, and the growth experienced year to year.

* Pie charts are better for illustrating percentages, rather than growth or trends.

* The heat map can show location data, as well as increased demand for parking. However, the location data might not be useful to the investors, and it is harder to clearly see the year on year increase in this format.

* The table may have too much data to be clear and concise.

### Recap

* Insights are critical to determine actions and help you focus on what is important to your business goals. An actionable insight takes this analysis one step further and determines what to do next, so that you can successfully improve and refine what you’re doing.

* Spreadsheets store data that can be arranged in many different ways. They have multiple inbuilt functions such as formulas, which you can use to make a variety of calculations in order to better understand the mass of inputted data.

* A heatmap is a visualisation map which allows you to see where and how visitors interact with your website. The brighter or hotter an area is, the more interactions occur on that section of the site.

## Build your online shop

---

A good way to start selling products online is to allow visitors to pay for their purchases via the website, using an online money transfer provider such as PayPal.

> Think about your current website and your own business needs. Are you ready for a full e-commerce platform? Or would it be easier to start out with a third-party payment processing solution?

* Adding reviews to your product pages can bring your products to life for the customer. Knowing how other customers feel about a product can inspire others to buy it and instil a feeling of trust.

* With e-commerce, your main costs are associated with your website, shipping and online payments. You'll also pay for your domain name, but all together these costs are typically less expensive than operating a physical shop where you can sell the same products or services.

* An e-commerce system allows customers to create accounts and manage their personal, billing and shipping information. Businesses can integrate multiple payment options, and even customise the checkout process. This can help improve your customer's online shopping experience, as well as help a business manage stock.

* A third party payment processor, such as PayPal, allows you to accept online payments without a merchant account of your own. This means you can focus on your business whilst someone else takes care of electronic transactions, as well as making the checkout process easier for customers.

## Improve the shopping experience

---

Sometimes it can be difficult for customers to find the best match for their needs. Product promotion and merchandising can help.

* Jo can use product recommendation engines to show related products and introduce customers to new products they might not have considered before.

> Write down a few items you’d like to promote to shoppers as they land on your website. Now, write down some recommendations you might want to make to customers based on what products they’ve shown an interest in.

* After shoppers have interacted with your website, **product retargeting** campaigns can help you get them back by showing them related ads across the web.

* Web analytics can show you at which point of the customer journey users are abandoning your site, signalling that there may be a problem with that specific page or feature. Analysing this data can then give you actionable insights.

* Product merchandising is all about how you display specific products to stimulate interest and entice customers to make a purchase.

* Once a visitor has visited a site, a small piece of data called a 'cookie' is added to the user's web browser. This means your adverts can then be displayed to them when they visit certain websites within the retargeting network.

## Expand Internationally

---

[Google Global Market Finder](http://translate.google.com/globalmarketfinder/g/index.html)

 Ready to dive into the global market? Before launching products or services to an international audience, it's important to validate your new markets, know the difference between translation and localisation and ensure you have the technical infrastructure to manage it all. Once you have a solid set-up, consider advertising across borders so that your marketing messages are seen by the right people, wherever they are.

* Matt can identify the best markets for his business by using helpful business tools like web analytics, trend reports and geographic data.

* Google Market Finder can show Matt that there is high search traffic on vintage record terms from Portugal. To Matt this may imply that a lot of people are looking for records out there.

* Low competition on search ads in Portugal would mean Matt wouldn’t be up against lots of other vintage record sellers. Google Keyword Planner is a useful tool for looking at the volume of search ads.

### Localization

Localisation is where you adapt content to suit the culture. For example, removing or rewriting colloquialisms, idioms or humourous content, and generally making the site feel as if it’s tailored to the needs of the new market.

Localisation might also include changing things like currency, addresses and cultural references to bring the content in line with the local market.

### Advertize across boarders

* Facebook would be a good place to advertise. However, Matt would need to engage a native speaker to manage the page, so he can have meaningful conversations with Portuguese fans.

* Do some research into social media sites in the countries you're considering targeting. Do they have social networks unique to their region? Are Facebook and Twitter just as popular there?

* Before expanding across boarders, there are a number of things you should check, including:

1. Customs duties or tariffs
2. Taxes
3. Exchange rates
4. Product safety requirements
5. Whether you needs insurance cover

Matt needs to make sure that:

1. His payment system can be used in the target country, and accounts for different currencies and taxes. Paypal and Worldpay are two systems that have an international focus.
2. He knows enough about the culture and the music scene to tailor his products to his customers.
3. His site works from an international point of view. Matt needs to run through the process a visitor would have when they access his site.

* You might have all your systems in place to accept international orders. But can you deliver your products accurately and on time? What about customer service and support? Are you prepared to handle refunds and exchanges across borders?

Matt needs to check the shipping process and the time and costs involved before he starts selling records to his Portuguese customers. Shipping across borders can be complicated and more costly.

Not all shipping companies support international shipping, and many require specific labels to ship, so Matt will need to do his research.

Matt will also want to make sure customers have a way to contact him from abroad in case of any issues.

> Explore the websites of the top shipping companies that serve your target markets and compare prices and cross-border services. Be sure to take into account your packaging sizes and any extra packaging requirements that may impact costs. Are there any savings when you compare companies? Does the company website note any additional services for shipping to your target country? Following your research, factor these estimates into your expansion costs.

### Recap

* Translation software isn't the most reliable source for accurate translations. Having a native speaker help will remove any potential errors in the copy for your website and make you aware of any cultural differences in the new market.

* Tools such as Google or Bing's keyword planner will give you insight into what terms are used for search ads in that region and in what volume.

* Translating your own content allows less room for mistakes. Some languages have different ways of phrasing things and alternative words, so trying to translate existing content will not necessarily work. It's best to start fresh for new markets.

* Search advertising is primarily meant to target new customers online. It gives businesses the opportunity to present themselves in front of new users who are using search engines to find a product, service or answer a question. The other options all involve a need for prior interest or a customer base to target.

* Before jumping into a new market you should fully research and identify any potential barriers to you conducting business. This will help you to gauge if your business is able to meet the needs of this new market while continuing to deliver great customer service.

* Different countries will have different preferred payment methods, so you'll need to research into these new markets. However, worldwide payment systems such as PayPal and Worldpay are a great solution for both the business and the customer.

* Having an understanding of the legal and tax considerations in the new market is imperative to running your business there, ensuring you don't break any laws. In addition, delivering products across borders may involve extra costs, such as taxes, that you'll need to factor into your pricing model.
